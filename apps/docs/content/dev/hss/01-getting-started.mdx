# Getting started

The Headless static site is a CLI tool that takes a folder of IIIF manifests and Collections and runs them through
a series of steps to produce a combined output that is suitable for powered static sites.

## Hello world example

To get started, let's download a piece of IIIF from the cookbook.

```sh
mkdir content
curl https://iiif.io/api/cookbook/recipe/0001-mvm-image/manifest.json > ./content/0001-mvm-image.json
```

Then create a `iiifrc.yml` for configuration

```yaml
server:
  url: http://localhost:7111 # this will be the URL for your Manifests.

stores:
  content:
    type: iiif-json
    path: ./content
    pattern: "**/*.json"
```

Now you can run the build command using `npx` or `pnpx`

```sh
> pnpx iiif-hss build

Done in 7ms
```

This process has created a folder `.iiif/build` with the output of the pipeline for our single manifest.

```
> tree .iiif/build

│   ├── overrides.json
│   ├── search
│   └── sitemap.json
└── stores
    └── default
        └── collection.json
```

There is a _lot_ of files here, so let's break them down.

### `/content`

This directory is our build IIIF, by default it will do a few things:

- Upgrade the IIIF to Presentation v3
- Update the URL with the one configured
- Move it into a folder with the name of the file. (`content/0001-mvm-image.json` becomes `content/0001-mvm-image/manifest.json`)
- Create some files alongside the Manifest
  - `manifest.json` - The IIIF Manifest itself.
  - `meta.json` - this is data that has been extracted from the Manifest. By default the label and number of items. This can be useful for loading snippets on a static site for listing pages. You can also use it for more complex use-cases.
  - `indices.json` - this will be explained later, but it allows you to group manifests together into Collections

### Collections

The pipeline will also create a variety of IIIF Collections. By default this will be:

- One top level collection at `/collection.json`
- A list of all Collections at `/collections/collection.json`
- A list of all Manifests at `/manifests/collection.json`
- A Collection for each "store" in your configuration `/stores/[name]/collection.json`

### `/meta`

This folder contains output from the process as a whole, this can be things like a sitemap which lists all resources, or analysis on the metadata to better inform configuration. This is also where combined files that are not IIIF live, such as search indexes.

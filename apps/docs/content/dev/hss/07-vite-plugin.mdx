This is still a work in progress, but to try it out you can install the "next" tag:

```bash
pnpm create vite
```

and go through the steps. Go into the directory and install the pre-release:

```bash
pnpm add -D iiif-hss@next
```

Create a `./content` folder and put IIIF Manifests in, and add the vite plugin:

```diff
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
+import iiif from "iiif-hss/vite-plugin";

// https://vite.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
   react(),
+  iiif()
],
});
```

That's it, no config required. If you spin up vite `pnpm dev` you will have all of the HSS server on `http://localhost:5173/iiif` such as:

- http://localhost:5173/iiif/collection.json - for the top level collection
- http://localhost:5173/iiif/create - form for creating new manifests
- http://localhost:5173/iiif/content/some-manifest/manifest.json - manifest URLs (+ meta, indicies, search-record etc.)
- http://localhost:5173/iiif/content/some-manifest/edit - redirect to edit in Manifest Editor.

Known issues:

- the `subFiles` configuration option is causing issues with creating new Manifests
- CORS issue with Manifest Editor when saving, have had it work sometimes and not others
- You need to create the `content` directory

Still remaining for an MVP:

- Build hook so the IIIF is exported in the dist directory on `vite build`
- Configuring the `server.url` via environment variables in HSS (for building).

Some ideas:

- API + Simple forms for:
  - Creating new IIIF
  - Importing IIIF from a Manifest or Collection URL
  - IIIF Browser embedded for importing
- Visualiser for the tracing (https://hss-trace.netlify.app/)
- Alternative method for pipeline extract/enrich scripts, in one place. (you can just define them in your vite config)
- Simple Astro or React template with Manifest navigation
- NextJS/Webpack dev server plugin adapted from this

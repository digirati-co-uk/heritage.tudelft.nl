Since 2017, when TU Delft celebrated its 175th anniversary, the university has been raising the profile of its academic heritage by systematically curating its collections, initiating research projects and organising on-campus presentations in collaboration with students and academic staff.

This website provides access to the different facets of the academic heritage team of TU Delft Library: digital editions of exhibitions, (digitised) items from the special collections and research output.

### Staff 

#### Team Academic Heritage, History and Art

The Academic Heritage, History and Art Department (AHHA) manages TU Delft's central heritage and art collections and undertakes various projects to showcase the collections and make them part of the campus. The collections broaden and deepen the view of the engineer (in training) who is naturally focused on the future and on solutions; on innovation. The heritage collections deepen that view by placing the present in the context of the past and the present in the context of the past. The art collections broaden the view by asking new questions, creating new contexts and thus arriving at new solutions. Through its broad network in both TU Delft and the cultural field, the AHHA department connects researchers, artists and heritage professionals to work together on innovative solutions. 
The Academic Heritage, History and Art team consists of:

- [Geertje van Achterberg](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/g.vanachterberg) (Project Lead for Presentation)
- [Kornelis Fragakis](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/k.fragakis/) (Curator Art Collection)
- [Sylvia Nijhuis](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/s.m.nijhuis/) (Curator Museum Collection)
- [Charlotte Rixten](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/c.rixten/) (Head)
- [Marietje Ruijgrok](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/m.c.j.ruijgrok/) (Curator Trésor)
- [Jules Schoonman](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/j.a.schoonman/) (Digital Curator)
- [Abel Streefland](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/a.h.streefland/) (University historian)

#### Team Tailor-made Approach to Faculty Collections

Over the decennia, the faculties of TU Delft have purchased and collected a wide variety of objects for teaching and/or research.  The objects often ended up in study collections, with informal care takers or in a random storage room. Some of these are now important historical objects, which were part of groundbreaking research or have been used by many generations of students in their education. In 2023, the Tailor-made Approach to Faculty Collections programme was launched to support the faculties in inventorying, (re)valuing and (re)using these objects.  Because every faculty and collection is different in terms of history, content and organisation, the programme will look for tailor-made solutions.The programme will run until the end of 2026.

Since April 2024, the Tailor-made Approach Faculty Collections team consists of:

- [Liselotte Neervoort] (Programme Manager)
- [Anna de Bruyn] (Project Lead CEG, Optics (AS), EEMCS and IDE)
- [Charlotte van Wijk](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/c.a.vanwijk/) (Project Lead ABE)
- [Cormac Duggan] (Project Lead AE, AS and ME)
- [Daphne van Wijngaarden](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/d.e.vanwijngaarden/) (Project Lead Digital)
- [Isabel Sinjorgo](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/i.d.j.sinjorgo/) (Registrar EEMCS, IDE and ABE)
- [Catherine Buckland](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/c.g.buckland) (Registrar EEMCS, AS and AE)
- [Inge Steijger](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/i.e.steijger/) (Process Advisor)
- [Thim Zuidwijk](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/t.zuidwijk/) (Collection Manager Optics (AS))

### IIIF

Built according to the specifications of the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), the website aims to promote creative reuse of the digital collections. For example, a [Manifest Editor](https://github.com/digirati-co-uk/iiif-manifest-editor) developed to curate digital exhibitions will become publicly available. More information about the project and its use of IIIF can be found in this Medium article by Digirati's Technology Director Tom Crane: [Reaching into collections to tell stories](https://medium.com/digirati-ch/reaching-into-collections-to-tell-stories-3dc32a1772af) and in Jules Schoonman's [presentation](https://youtu.be/VnqtYzxyY64) at the IIIF Community Call on 11 March 2020.

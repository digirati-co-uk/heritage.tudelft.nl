TU Delft Library's Academic Heritage, History and Art team manages the university's special collections, organises on-campus exhibitions in co-curation with students and staff, researches the university's history, and offers support to faculty collections.

The special collections consist of the Museum Collection, Trésor and Art Collection. The Museum Collection originates from the former Museum of Technology and consists of objects drawing from TU Delft's rich institutional history, education and research. The Trésor includes the Library's rare books, journals, maps, prints and photographs. The Art Collection features modern and contemporary art displayed across the university's campus while continuing to grow through new acquisitions and commissioned works.

### Staff 

#### Team Academic Heritage, History and Art

The Academic Heritage, History and Art Department (AHHA) manages TU Delft's central heritage and art collections and undertakes various projects to showcase the collections and make them part of the campus. The collections broaden and deepen the view of the engineer (in training) who is naturally focused on the future and on solutions; on innovation. The heritage collections deepen that view by placing the present in the context of the past and the present in the context of the past. The art collections broaden the view by asking new questions, creating new contexts and thus arriving at new solutions. Through its broad network in both TU Delft and the cultural field, the AHHA department connects researchers, artists and heritage professionals to work together on innovative solutions. 
The Academic Heritage, History and Art team consists of:

- [Geertje van Achterberg](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/g.vanachterberg) (Project Lead for Presentation)

#### Team Tailor-made Approach to Faculty Collections

Over the decennia, the faculties of TU Delft have purchased and collected a wide variety of objects for teaching and/or research.  The objects often ended up in study collections, with informal care takers or in a random storage room. Some of these are now important historical objects, which were part of groundbreaking research or have been used by many generations of students in their education. In 2023, the Tailor-made Approach to Faculty Collections programme was launched to support the faculties in inventorying, (re)valuing and (re)using these objects.  Because every faculty and collection is different in terms of history, content and organisation, the programme will look for tailor-made solutions.The programme will run until the end of 2026.

Since April 2024, the Tailor-made Approach Faculty Collections team consists of:

- [Liselotte Neervoort] (Programme Manager)
- [Anna de Bruyn] (Project Lead CEG, Optics (AS), EEMCS and IDE)
- [Charlotte van Wijk](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/c.a.vanwijk/) (Project Lead ABE)
- [Cormac Duggan] (Project Lead AE, AS and ME)
- [Daphne van Wijngaarden](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/d.e.vanwijngaarden/) (Project Lead Digital)
- [Isabel Sinjorgo](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/i.d.j.sinjorgo/) (Registrar EEMCS, IDE and ABE)
- [Catherine Buckland](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/c.g.buckland) (Registrar EEMCS, AS and AE)
- [Inge Steijger](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/i.e.steijger/) (Process Advisor)
- [Thim Zuidwijk](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/t.zuidwijk/) (Collection Manager Optics (AS))

### Tailor-made Approach to Faculty Collections

Since the foundation of the Delft Royal Academy in 1842, the departments and later faculties of TU Delft have collected a wide variety of objects for teaching and research.  These objects often ended up in study collections, with informal caretakers or were locked away in storage rooms. Some have gained significant historical value, having been used for groundbreaking research or for the education of subsequent generations of students.

In order to support faculties in inventorying, evaluating and (re)using their collections, the _Tailor-made Approach to Faculty Collections_ programme was launched in 2022. Due to the differences among faculties and collections in terms of their history, content and organisation, the programme prefers tailor-made solutions. The programme runs until the end of 2026.

Since April 2024, the Tailor-made Approach to Faculty Collections team consists of:

- [Catherine Buckland](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/c.g.buckland) (registrar EEMCS, AS and AE)
- [Cormac Duggan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cormac-duggan-382bb3234) (project lead AE, AS and ME)
- [Liselotte Neervoort](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liselotte-neervoort-b0b01324) (programme manager)
- [Isabel Sinjorgo](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/i.d.j.sinjorgo/) (registrar EEMCS, IDE and ABE)
- [Inge Steijger](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/i.e.steijger/) (process advisor)
- [Charlotte van Wijk](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/c.a.vanwijk/) (project lead ABE)
- [Daphne van Wijngaarden](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/d.e.vanwijngaarden/) (project lead digital)
- [Thim Zuidwijk](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/t.zuidwijk/) (collection manager Optics, AS)

### Open data

Built according to the specifications of the [International Image Interoperability Framework](https://iiif.io/) (IIIF), this website aims to promote creative reuse of the digital collections. For example, a [Manifest Editor](https://manifest-editor.digirati.services/) developed to curate digital exhibitions has become publicly available. More information about the project and its use of IIIF can be found in the article [Reaching into collections to tell stories](https://medium.com/digirati-ch/reaching-into-collections-to-tell-stories-3dc32a1772af) by Digirati's Technology Director Tom Crane, and in Jules Schoonman's [presentation](https://youtu.be/VnqtYzxyY64) at the IIIF Community Call on 11 March 2020.

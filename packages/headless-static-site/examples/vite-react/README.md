# Vite + React example (shorthand mode)

Uses `iiif-hss/vite-plugin` with shorthand configuration:

- `collection: "https://theseusviewer.org/cookbook-collection.json"`

The React app uses `createIiifViteClient()` from `iiif-hss/vite/client` and fetches manifests from:

- `/iiif/manifests/collection.json`

## Run

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

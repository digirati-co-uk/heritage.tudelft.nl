## üí´ About

Since 2017, when TU Delft celebrated its 175th anniversary, the university has been raising the profile of its academic heritage by systematically curating its collections, initiating research projects and organising on-campus presentations in collaboration with students and academic staff.

This website provides access to the different facets of the academic heritage team of TU Delft Library: digital editions of exhibitions, (digitised) items from the special collections and research output.

## üöÄ Developing locally

1.  **Dependancies**

    [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

    Bun is a fast javascript runtime similar (and mostly compatible) with NodeJS. It's well suited for the data processing used in the static site generator.

    ```sh
    curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    From the route of the project install the latest project dependancies and start the development server.

    ```sh
    bun install
    ```

    then run a first build, to create the IIIF:
    ```sh
    bun run build
    ```

    to start the development server run

    ```sh
    bun dev
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:3000`!

## üßê Directories?

The project is a [Monorepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) with multiple projects in the same repository. There are 2 main applications. The IIIF building pipeline and the static site. They can be found under the `apps` directory.

## üí´ Deploy

    Run auto linting on your code to conform to the project standards

    ```sh
    bun run lint
    ```

    Building the project. It is recommended you confirm the build is running and passing before any pushes to the project repository.

    ```sh
    bun run build
    ```

Once you have a running build push to the project repo and open a pull request. Netlify will automatically build a preview of your branch and the details are availible on the pull request if you add a label  "Deploy preview" to the pull request.

Main branch is automatically deployed to the live site.
